          <h1 id="title">Past Events In Pakistan</h1>
          <p id="content">It is impossible to comprehend the enormous scope of the destruction and human suffering caused by the August floods, which are now wreaking havoc throughout much of Pakistan. The fact that the floods aren't wholly unprecedented is arguably the most heartbreaking element about them. In truth, Pakistan was just the victim of one of the worst flood catastrophes in contemporary history.


          <br>
          <br>
          We won't know for sure until the present floods have subsided, but in some ways, the 2010 floods may have been much worse than the 2022 occurrence.
          <br>
          <br>
          In 2010, Pakistan had monsoonal rains that lasted far longer and were much more strong than usual. This led to flooding that was even worse than what the nation experienced over the weekend.
          <br>
          <br>
          According to NASA, there were many weeks of rain, with cumulative amounts 70 percent above average in July and 102 percent above average in August. When the floods caused the Manchhar Lake to overflow and it combined with adjacent rivers and streams, a comparable basin was created that covered hundreds of square kilometers.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Pakistan floods, according to the U.S. Agency for International Development, affected nearly 20 million people, resulted in 1,961 fatalities, and damaged or destroyed 1.9 million dwellings.

          <h2>Small Background of Flooding in 2020</h2>
          <p id="content">When 231 mm of rain fell in under 12 hours in August 2020, Karachi saw the highest day of rain in recorded history. Only Karachi had 484 mm (19 inches) of rain in August 2020. Over the past 90 years, this rainfall record is the highest. Numerous residential areas, including urban slums and villages in peri-urban regions, were severely affected by flooding caused by rainwater and overflowing water from nullahs and sewers. This severely interrupted the life of the residents.
          </p>

          <h2>Why is Pakistan such a climatic shock-sensitive country?</h2>
          <p id="content">
            Pakistan is one of the nations most affected by climate change even though it is one of the least responsible contributors. Pakistan has regularly ranked among the top 10 nations most susceptible to climate change over the past 20 years. There are several causes for this. Pakistan's terrain is diverse, with several glaciers in the north, dry deserts and productive agricultural plains in the center, and megacities like Karachi that are very near to the sea and will be negatively impacted by rising sea levels.
            <br>
            <br>
            The lack of political will and poor governance contribute to Pakistan's susceptibility to climatic shocks. As mentioned above, unauthorized and unchecked building, particularly in sensitive locations, has increased the disaster's severity. But there is also a gap between science and public policy. Although Pakistan is not the only country affected by this problem, its authorities have been aware of it for at least 20 years.
