        <p class="indextext">The extent of the destruction is becoming more and more clear as the floodwaters recede. Along with several public health institutions, water systems, and schools, tens of thousands of residences have also been lost or damaged. Young children are exposed to a variety of increased flood-related dangers and hazards, such as from damaged houses and drowning in floodwaters, while living in the open with their family without access to drinking water, food, or a means of support.</p>
